This is an NFT-powered DAO to invest in NFT-Collection as a group, deployed on Sepolia network.

It has been done following this [LearnWeb3 tutorial](https://learnweb3.io/degrees/ethereum-developer-degree/sophomore/build-an-nft-powered-fully-on-chain-dao-to-invest-in-nft-collections-as-a-group/) for learning purposes. 

The deployed version can be used in [Vercel](https://on-chain-dao-muzta.vercel.app/)

This project consists of 
- An NFT contract for the CryptoDevs collection, which will give vote power to holders.
- A fake NFT marketplace, so the purchase proposals by CryptoDevs holders are able to purchase NFTs automatically.
- A DAO contract so proposals can be created and executed.
- A simple website using Next.js to allow an easy use of the application.
